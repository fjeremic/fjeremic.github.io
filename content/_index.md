I'm a software developer working for [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/) on Machine Learning (ML) compilers and ML model performance simulations and projections on Qualcomm hardware.

I love open-source technologies and regularly explore [projects](/projects/) which allow me to learn something new and share with the world. I sometimes [blog](/blog/) about topics that interest me.
