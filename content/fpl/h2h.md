## Rules

1. You can only join this Head-To-Head league if you are also in the [Classic](../classic) league. This discourages
players from having "free" wildcards before the start of the subsequent quarter.
2. Maximum number of players is 20. This is to ensure each player will play each other at least twice before the end of
the season.
3. Scoring system is broken up into four individual quarters and is outlined below
4. Payments are to be made by **{{< fpl-get-data "h2h" "joinDeadline" >}}** or you risk eviction from the league.
See the [Payment](#payment) for more details.

### Scoring System

The scoring system is based off of the official [Head-To-Head](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/help/rules) Fantasy
Premier League rules. There are four (4) separate quarters in which the players will compete for individual quarter
winnings:

|                        | Game Weeks (inclusive) | # Of Weeks In Quarter |
|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:---------------------:|
| 1<sup>st</sup> quarter | GW1 - GW10             | 10                    |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> quarter | GW11 - GW19            | 9                     |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter | GW20 - GW29            | 10                    |
| 4<sup>th</sup> quarter | GW30 - GW38            | 9                     |


Within each quarter the point system is exactly the same as in the official Head-To-Head scoring system, meaning a win
earns you three (3) points, a tie earns you one (1) point, and a loss earns you zero (0) points. The player with the
most number of points each quarter is declared the quarter winner. In the event of a point tie the total number of FPL
points (as reported on the official Head-To-Head league tables) accumulated in the respective quarter will be used as a
tie breaker. In the event of a point tie and FPL point tie the winnings will be split among the first place finishers.

In the event of game week postponements (ex. due to COVID-19 or other events), each game week postponed will be added
to the number of game weeks played in the corresponding quarter. For example if two (2) game weeks are postponed in Q3,
then the total number of game weeks played in Q3 will be 9 + 2 = 11.

Real-time up-to-date [Standings](#standings) will be made available once the Head-To-Head matches are scheduled on the
official league page.

### Payout Structure

The following payout structure will be used to distribute the funds collected at the end of each quarter. The overall
winner is the winner of the official Head-To-Head league as dictated by the official rules (the first place head-to-head
finisher at the end of the season).

|                               | Payout       | 
|:-----------------------------:|:------------:|
| 1<sup>st</sup> quarter winner | 20% of pot   |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> quarter winner | 20% of pot   |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter winner | 20% of pot   |
| 4<sup>th</sup> quarter winner | 20% of pot   |
| Overall winner                | 20% of pot   |
