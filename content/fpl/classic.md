### League Cup

The league cup starts in the second half of the season. The first week of the cup will be determined based on the
number of players in the league. Each team will be randomly drawn against another in the first round. The winner (the 
team with the highest Game Week score minus any transfer points), will progress to the second round and another random
draw, the losers are out! This process continues until the final round when the two remaining teams contest the cup 
final.

If a cup match is drawn, then the following tie-breaks will be applied until a winner is found:

1. Most goals scored in the Game Week
2. Fewest goals conceded in the Game Week
3. Virtual coin toss
