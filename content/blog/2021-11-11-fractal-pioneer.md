I finished a side project! How often in life can a SWE say that? In 2011 I had the pleasure of taking an introductory
computer graphics course taught by Dr. Robert Teather at McMaster University. At the time I was fascinated by fractals
and computer hardware was just beginning to be fast enough to render them in real time. As my final project for the
course I implemented a 3D fractal viewer which looked awful and ran very slowly at small resolutions.

One decade later I wanted to put my skills to the test and reminisce my university days by reimplementing the project
with a more cinematic edge, followed by open sourcing the application and writing a technical writeup on how everything
works.

Take a minute to relax and watch a video programmatically created by the
