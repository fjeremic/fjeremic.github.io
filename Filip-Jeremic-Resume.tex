\section{\sc Interests}

Compiler development (static and dynamic), programming languages (design and implementation), machine learning, data
science, parallelization, computer graphics, software protection, reverse engineering, and malware analysis.

\section{\sc Technical \newline Skills}

{\bf C, C++, Python, x86-64 Assembly, C\#, Java} \\
{\em Expert, 10+ years}

These technologies are the ones which I have used the most over the years. Because of my field of interest, low level
programming languages such as various flavors of assembly, C, and C++ have been my primary languages of choice. Working 
on a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for Java has made me deeply familiar with these languages both from the angle of 
software engineering and performance optimization.

{\bf Linux, Unix tools, Windows, Docker, Jenkins, CMake, Bash, Qt } \\
{\em Advanced, 7+ years}

My primary development platforms is Linux. I am very comfortable within a Unix environment carrying out tasks such as
instruction level performance investigations (perf), assembly or source level debugging (gdb, IDA, Ollydgb, etc.), and
remote SSH development using the technologies listed above.

{\bf NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, JavaScript, Perl, HTML, WPF } \\
{\em Experienced, 1+ years}

\section{\sc Professional Experience}

{\bf Qualcomm}, Toronto, Canada

{\em ML/Compiler development - Senior Staff Software Engineer} \hfill {\bf 2021 - Present}
\vspace{-.12in}

At Qualcomm I'm leading a small team focused on applying Machine Learning (ML) and data science to predict performance
characteristics (ex. execution cycles) of ML operations (ex. convolution) on Qualcomm hardware. These ML models are
used to improve optimizations within a production ML compiler so we can perform faster inference and to accurately
predict KPIs on existing and future hardware.

{\bf IBM}, Toronto, Canada

{\em Compiler development - Advisory Software Engineer} \hfill {\bf 2017 - 2021}
\vspace{-.12in}

A natural progression of my previous position into a team leader role. During this exciting time we worked on open
sourcing our compiler technology as part of the \href{https://github.com/eclipse/openj9}{Eclipse OpenJ9} and 
\href{https://github.com/eclipse/omr}{Eclipse OMR} projects on GitHub. As the open source communities grew, my role has
been evolving into being one of the focal points for cross-platform JIT compiler development and community management.

\vspace{.10in}

\begin{itemize}
\item Elected as a committer/maintainer on both projects (200+ contributors each)
\item Top code 
\href{https://github.com/eclipse/omr/graphs/contributors?from=2016-03-06&to=2021-09-24&type=c}{contributor}
across both projects
\item Heavily involved in technical
\href{https://github.com/eclipse/omr/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+reviewed-by%3Afjeremic+is%3Aclosed+}{review}
of community pull requests, and driving backend compiler design and direction
\item Continued leadership of the backed code generator team which successfully shipped the Java 11 and Java 17 long-
term support (LTS) releases
\end{itemize}

\newpage

{\em Compiler development - Staff Software Engineer} \hfill {\bf 2015 - 2017}
\vspace{-.12in}

An extension of my previous role with a broader focus primarily on performance acceleration of Java workloads on Linux
and z/OS. Part of my role involved sharing some of the team lead responsibilities in driving technical direction and
management of backlog.

\vspace{.10in}

\begin{itemize}
\item Wrote intermediate language (IL) level optimizations benefiting all compiler backends (x86, ARM, AArch64, RISC-V,
Power, z/Architecture)
\item Delivered flagship features including String compression and Pause-less garbage collection in support of the Java
9 release
\end{itemize}

{\em Compiler development - Associate Software Engineer} \hfill {\bf 2013 - 2015}
\vspace{-.12in}

Directly after graduation I took a position at IBM's compiler group where I worked on the backend of the just-in-time
(JIT) compiler for the IBM J9 Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

\vspace{.10in}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed and improved compiler features including intrinsics, register allocation, instruction scheduling, 
and optimal instruction selection for various processors
\item Performed instruction level performance investigations and realized 10\% improvement targets on key benchmarks
prior to new generation processor release dates
\item Postmortem core dump analysis of non-deterministic code generator bugs
\item Developed a firm understanding the interaction between the various components of a dynamic runtime environment 
(VM, GC, JIT), particularly in the context of a JVM
\end{itemize}
