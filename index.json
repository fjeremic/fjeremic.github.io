How often in life can a SWE say that? In 2011 I had the pleasure of taking an introductory computer graphics course taught by Dr. Robert Teather at McMaster University. At the time I was fascinated by fractals and computer hardware was just beginning to be fast enough to render them in real time. As my final project for the course I implemented a 3D fractal viewer which looked awful and ran very slowly at small resolutions.\nOne decade later I wanted to put my skills to the test and reminisce my university days by reimplementing the project with a more cinematic edge, followed by open sourcing the application and writing a technical writeup on how everything works.\nTake a minute to relax and watch a video programmatically created by the\nFractal Pioneer - An Open Source Realtime 3D Fractal Explorer In 4K:\n  ","date":"11 November 2021","permalink":"/blog/fractal-pioneer/","section":"Blogs","summary":"I finished a side project!","title":"Fractal Pioneer"},{"content":"\n   Click/tap to view the standings or see all leagues  Rules #  Maximum number of players is âˆž Scoring system is identical to the official Fantasy Premier League Payments are to be made by  8:00 p.m. EST Friday August 12th, 2021 or you risk eviction from the league.

In case of a tie the player with the smaller overall score gets eliminated. In case of further ties a coin flip is done for who gets eliminated. If there are more than 39 players in the league then 2 players will be eliminated each week until the number of players left in the league is 1 more than the number of GWs left in the season. At that point we revert back to eliminating a single player each week.

Given the compensation packages offered by our neighbours south of the border, it may make financial sense to take on a remote employment opportunity earning USD while remaining a Canadian resident. For purposes of income tax the Canada Revenue Agency requires that you report any income in CAD 1. However CRA does give some leeway in how you must report the foreign employment income:\n Foreign employment income is income earned outside Canada from a foreign employer. Report this income in Canadian dollars. Use the Bank of Canada exchange rate in effect on the day you received the income. If the amount was paid at various times in the year, you can use the average annual rate.\n This means that for income tax purposes we can calculate the income tax in Canadian dollars using both the daily exchange rate and the annual exchange rate and use the lower of the two to report on our income taxes so as to reduce our total tax owed.\nExample # Consider Fred, a contract worker offering his services to a US based company remotely while residing in Canada for the duration of the 2018 tax year. The contract between Fred and the US based company dictates the payment schedule for his services to be a total of $5,000 USD which is deposited (in USD) into a cross-border bank account on the first Friday of every month.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see what Fred\u0026rsquo;s employment income looks like using the Bank of Canada Daily Exchange Rates:\n   Date Income (USD) Exchange Rate Income (CAD)     2018-01-05 $5,000.00 1.2403 $6,201.50   2018-02-02 $5,000.00 1.2380 $6,190.00   2018-03-02 $5,000.00 1.2891 $6,445.50   2018-04-06 $5,000.00 1.2764 $6,382.00   2018-05-04 $5,000.00 1.2861 $6,430.50   2018-06-01 $5,000.00 1.2964 $6,482.00   2018-07-06 $5,000.00 1.3105 $6,552.50   2018-08-03 $5,000.00 1.2983 $6,491.50   2018-09-07 $5,000.00 1.3164 $6,582.00   2018-10-05 $5,000.00 1.2936 $6,468.00   2018-11-02 $5,000.00 1.3105 $6,552.50   2018-12-07 $5,000.00 1.3299 $6,649.50   Total $60,000.00  $77,427.50    The Bank of Canada Annual Exchange Rate from USD to CAD in 2018 was 1.2957, which translates Fred\u0026rsquo;s $60,000 USD income to $77,742 CAD. The difference in CAD denominated income taxes between the annual exchange rate and the daily exchange rate is $314.50 CAD. Choosing to use the daily exchange rate to report Fred\u0026rsquo;s income for 2018 will save him roughly $100 in income taxes owed based on his marginal tax rate in the province which he resides.\nA Word of Caution # If the currency fluctuation for a given year is too significant, CRA may not accept using the annual exchange rate, as per Section 1.6.1 quoted below 2. However the meaning of \u0026ldquo;significantly\u0026rdquo; is not defined, so tread carefully if the difference in taxes owed using the above calculations is large.\n 1.6.1 For practical reasons, the CRA may also accept the use of an average of exchange rates over a period of time in order to convert certain income items. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly, the use of the average exchange rate for a period will not generally be accepted. Note that a taxpayer transitioning in or out of income tax reporting using an elected functional currency must use the Bank of Canada rate as described in Â¶1.4 and 1.5 in converting the amounts required by subsections 261(7) or 261(12) and related provisions.\n   Line 104 - Foreign employment income\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Income Tax Folio S5-F4-C1, Income Tax Reporting Currency\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":"15 July 2019","permalink":"/blog/tax-advantageous-reporting-of-employment-income/","section":"Blogs","summary":"In the tech world remote employment positions are becoming more popular in recent years.","title":"Tax Advantageous Reporting of Foreign Employment Income"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m a software developer working for Qualcomm on Machine Learning (ML) compilers and ML model performance simulations and projections on Qualcomm hardware.
