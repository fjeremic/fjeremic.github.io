There are four (4) separate quarters in which the players will compete for individual quarter winnings:\n    Game Weeks (inclusive) # Of Weeks In Quarter     1st quarter GW1 - GW10 10   2nd quarter GW11 - GW19 9   3rd quarter GW20 - GW29 10   4th quarter GW30 - GW38 9    Within each quarter the point system is exactly the same as in the official Head-To-Head scoring system, meaning a win earns you three (3) points, a tie earns you one (1) point, and a loss earns you zero (0) points. The player with the most number of points each quarter is declared the quarter winner. In the event of a point tie the total number of FPL points (as reported on the official Head-To-Head league tables) accumulated in the respective quarter will be used as a tie breaker. In the event of a point tie and FPL point tie the winnings will be split among the first place finishers.\nIn the event of game week postponements (ex. due to COVID-19 or other events), each game week postponed will be added to the number of game weeks played in the corresponding quarter. For example if two (2) game weeks are postponed in Q3, then the total number of game weeks played in Q3 will be 9 + 2 = 11.\nReal-time up-to-date Standings will be made available once the Head-To-Head matches are scheduled on the official league page.\nPayout Structure # The following payout structure will be used to distribute the funds collected at the end of each quarter.

Scoring System # The goal of this league is for there to be one Last Man Standing in GW38. This means players are evicted from the league based on their performance as we progress through the season.\n The player with the lowest score of the GW according to the FPL league scoring rules gets eliminated from the league. In case of a tie the player with the smaller overall score gets eliminated. In case of further ties a coin flip is done for who gets eliminated. If there are more than 39 players in the league then 2 players will be eliminated each week until the number of players left in the league is 1 more than the number of GWs left in the season. At that point we revert back to eliminating a single player each week. If there are less than 39 players in the league then no players is evicted until the number of players in the league is 1 more than the number of GWs left in the season. At that point we begin eliminating a single player each week.

Given the compensation packages offered by our neighbours south of the border, it may make financial sense to take on a remote employment opportunity earning USD while remaining a Canadian resident. For purposes of income tax the Canada Revenue Agency requires that you report any income in CAD 1. However CRA does give some leeway in how you must report the foreign employment income:\n Foreign employment income is income earned outside Canada from a foreign employer. Report this income in Canadian dollars. Use the Bank of Canada exchange rate in effect on the day you received the income. If the amount was paid at various times in the year, you can use the average annual rate.\n This means that for income tax purposes we can calculate the income tax in Canadian dollars using both the daily exchange rate and the annual exchange rate and use the lower of the two to report on our income taxes so as to reduce our total tax owed.\nExample # Consider Fred, a contract worker offering his services to a US based company remotely while residing in Canada for the duration of the 2018 tax year. The contract between Fred and the US based company dictates the payment schedule for his services to be a total of $5,000 USD which is deposited (in USD) into a cross-border bank account on the first Friday of every month.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see what Fred\u0026rsquo;s employment income looks like using the Bank of Canada Daily Exchange Rates:\n   Date Income (USD) Exchange Rate Income (CAD)     2018-01-05 $5,000.00 1.2403 $6,201.50   2018-02-02 $5,000.00 1.2380 $6,190.00   2018-03-02 $5,000.00 1.2891 $6,445.50   2018-04-06 $5,000.00 1.2764 $6,382.00   2018-05-04 $5,000.00 1.2861 $6,430.50   2018-06-01 $5,000.00 1.2964 $6,482.00   2018-07-06 $5,000.00 1.3105 $6,552.50   2018-08-03 $5,000.00 1.2983 $6,491.50   2018-09-07 $5,000.00 1.3164 $6,582.00   2018-10-05 $5,000.00 1.2936 $6,468.00   2018-11-02 $5,000.00 1.3105 $6,552.50   2018-12-07 $5,000.00 1.3299 $6,649.50   Total $60,000.00  $77,427.50    The Bank of Canada Annual Exchange Rate from USD to CAD in 2018 was 1.2957, which translates Fred\u0026rsquo;s $60,000 USD income to $77,742 CAD. The difference in CAD denominated income taxes between the annual exchange rate and the daily exchange rate is $314.50 CAD. Choosing to use the daily exchange rate to report Fred\u0026rsquo;s income for 2018 will save him roughly $100 in income taxes owed based on his marginal tax rate in the province which he resides.\nA Word of Caution # If the currency fluctuation for a given year is too significant, CRA may not accept using the annual exchange rate, as per Section 1.6.1 quoted below 2. However the meaning of \u0026ldquo;significantly\u0026rdquo; is not defined, so tread carefully if the difference in taxes owed using the above calculations is large.\n 1.6.1 For practical reasons, the CRA may also accept the use of an average of exchange rates over a period of time in order to convert certain income items. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly, the use of the average exchange rate for a period will not generally be accepted. Note that a taxpayer transitioning in or out of income tax reporting using an elected functional currency must use the Bank of Canada rate as described in ¶1.4 and 1.5 in converting the amounts required by subsections 261(7) or 261(12) and related provisions.\n   Line 104 - Foreign employment income\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Income Tax Folio S5-F4-C1, Income Tax Reporting Currency\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":"15 July 2019","permalink":"/blog/tax-advantageous-reporting-of-employment-income/","section":"Blogs","summary":"In the tech world remote employment positions are becoming more popular in recent years.","title":"Tax Advantageous Reporting of Foreign Employment Income"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m a software developer working for Qualcomm on Machine Learning (ML) compilers and ML model performance simulations and projections on Qualcomm hardware.
