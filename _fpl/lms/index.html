    Scoring System
</h3>

The goal of this league is for there to be one Last Man Standing in GW38. This means players are evicted from the league based on their performance as we progress through the season.

<ol>
    <li>The player with the lowest score of the GW according to the FPL league scoring rules gets eliminated from the league. In case of a tie the player with the smaller overall score gets eliminated. In case of further ties a coin flip is done for who gets eliminated.</li>
    <li>If there are more than 39 players in the league then 2 players will be eliminated each week until the number of players left in the league is 1 more than the number of GWs left in the season. At that point we revert back to eliminating a single player each week.</li>
    <li>If there are less than 39 players in the league then no players is evicted until the number of players in the league is 1 more than the number of GWs left in the season. At that point we begin eliminating a single player each week</li>
</ol>
