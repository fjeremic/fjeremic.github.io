<ol>
    <li>You can only join this Head-To-Head league if you are also in the <a href="../classic">Classic</a> league.
        This discourages people from having "free" wildcards before the start of the subsequent quarter.</li>
    <li>Maximum number of players is 20. This is to ensure each player will play each other at least twice before
        the end of the season.</li>
    <li>Scoring system is broken up into four induvidual quarters and is outlined below</li>
    <li>Payments are to be made by {{ site.data.fpl[page.category].join-deadline }} or you risk eviction from the
        league. See the <a href="payment">Payment</a> page for more details.</li>

    Scoring System
</h3>

The scoring system is based off of the official Head-To-Head <a href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/help/rules">Fantasy Premier League</a> rules. There are four (4)
separate quarters in which the players will compete for induvidual quarter winnings:

<div class="table-responsive">
    <table class="table table-bordered text-center text-nowrap mt-4 mb-4">
        <thead class="thead-light">
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th>Game Weeks (inclusive)</th>
                <th># Of Weeks In Quarter</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1<sup>st</sup> quarter</td>
                <td>GW1 - GW10</td>
                <td>10</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2<sup>nd</sup> quarter</td>
                <td>GW11 - GW19</td>
                <td>9</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3<sup>rd</sup> quarter</td>
                <td>GW20 - GW29</td>
                <td>10</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4<sup>th</sup> quarter</td>
                <td>GW30 - GW28</td>
                <td>9</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

<p>
    Within each quarter the point system is exactly the same as in the official Head-To-Head scoring system, meaning a
    win earns you three (3) points, a tie earns you one (1) point, and a loss earns you zero (0) points. The player
    with the most number of points each quarter is declared the quarter winner. In the event of a point tie the total
    number of FPL points (as reported on the official Head-To-Head leage tables) accumulated in the respective quarter
    will be used as a tie breaker. In the event of a point tie and FPL point tie the winnings will be split among the
    first place finishers.

    Real-time up-to-date <a href="standings">Standings</a> will be made available once the Head-To-Head
    matches are
    scheduled on the official league page.

<h3 class="mt-4 mb-4">
    Payout Structure
</h3>

<p>
    The following payout structure will be used to distribute the funds collected at the end of each quarter. The
    overall winner is the winner of the official Head-To-Head league as dictated by the official rules (the first place
    head-to-head finisher at the end of the season).
