    League Cup
</h3>

The league cup starts in the second half of the season. The first week of the cup will be determined based on the number
of players in the league. Each team will be randomly drawn against another in the first round. The winner (the team with
the highest Game Week score minus any transfer points), will progress to the second round and another random draw, the 
losers are out! This process continues until the final round when the two remaining teams contest the cup final.
<br>
<br>
If a cup match is drawn, then the following tie-breaks will be applied until a winner is found:
<ol>
    <li>Most goals scored in the Game Week</li>
    <li>Fewest goals conceded in the Game Week</li>
    <li>Virtual coin toss</li>
</ol>
